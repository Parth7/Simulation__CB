Hi 

The executable and the object files have already been created. 
You can view all the .cpp and .h files in the folder attached. Explanation for each class has been added and commented. 

In the cmake-build-debug folder, we have the executable that you can directly run on your system using command prompt.
First cd into the cmake-build-debug directory and then use the command :
./conveyer_belt

Since we are using random number generator, the output will vary. It's been compiled using C++17.
The object files created are present in the /cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/conveyer_belt.dir/

Please let me know if you have any questions. 
Regards, 
Parth Parakh
